    <h2>Addon</h2>
    <p>
        The following is a prototype add-on for Firefox and Fennec that implements a proof-of-concept of fly web.  The add-on is unsigned, and only installable on Firefox Nightly instances.  Please note that this add-on is insecure and most likely will make and should not be used except for testing purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
        To install the add-on, open Firefox Nightly (or Fennec Nightly on Android).  Go to "about:config" and set "xpinstall.signatures.required" to "false".  Then follow the link below and a dialog will pop up requesting permission to install the add-on.  Select "allow", and the add-on will be installed.
